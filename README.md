# 🦀 Rust Journey

Welcome to my Rust learning repository!  
This repo is where I document my journey of learning the Rust programming language.  
It includes practice exercises, notes, small projects, and experiments along the way.

## 📖 About
Rust is a systems programming language focused on:
- **Performance**
- **Safety (no null, no data races)**
- **Concurrency**

I’m using this repo as a place to:
- Practice Rust fundamentals
- Solve exercises (like from [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings))
- Build small projects to strengthen my understanding

## 🚀 Topics Covered
- [ ] Variables & Mutability  
- [ ] Ownership & Borrowing  
- [ ] Structs & Enums  
- [ ] Pattern Matching
